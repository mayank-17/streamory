# Streamory

*Your real-time analytics backend platform — fast, flexible, and developer-friendly.*

</div>

## Why the Name "Streamory"?

We picked **Streamory** because it feels just right for whamv this project is all about:

- **Stream** stands for the continuous flow of data — like all those events and interactions happening in real time inside your app.
- **Story** hints at the bigger picture — the story your data tells about how users behave and how your product performs.

Put them together, and **Streamory** means a real-time memory for your product — helping teams see what’s happening, understand it quickly, and improve things faster.

### What’s with the Logo?

The logo’s wave shape is inspired by flowing streams of data — always moving, always fresh.

It’s a simple, clean symbol of how data pipelines work: smooth, flexible, and built to handle whatever you throw at them.

The blue gradient reflects qualities we care about: clarity, depth, and reliability — just like how we want your analytics to feel.

## 📦 SDK (`@mynq/streamory-sdk`)

A lightweight, ESM-compatible SDK for tracking frontend events securely.

### ✅ Features

- Drop-in usage for browser apps
- Bearer token authentication
- Auto token refresh (optional)
- Minimal footprint
- Works with modern frameworks (React, Vue, etc.)

### 📥 Installation

```bash
npm install @mynq/streamory-sdk
```

### 🧪 Example

```ts
import StreamorySDK from "@mynq/streamory-sdk";

const sdk = new StreamorySDK("ACCESS_TOKEN", "https://api.streamory.com/v1/events");

sdk.track("user_signup", {
  plan: "Pro",
  referrer: "Twitter"
});
```

## 🔐 Auth Design

- Access Token + Refresh Token
- Tokens stored safely per project
- Refresh tokens used to renew expired access tokens
- SDK handles refresh automatically
- No hardcoding long-lived secrets in browser

---

## 🌐 Ingestion API

- Express-based ingestion endpoint
- Validates and queues events to Kafka
- Future: per-project key validation, rate limiting, quotas

### Planned Endpoints

- `POST /v1/events` - Ingests events
- `GET /v1/health` - Healthcheck
- `POST /v1/auth/token` - Refresh access tokens *(WIP)*

---

## 🛠️ Infrastructure

- Kafka for queuing
- ClickHouse for storage
- Docker + Kubernetes for orchestration
- Future: Support Helm Charts, Terraform module

---

## 🧭 Roadmap

- [x] Build and publish initial SDK
- [x] Basic ingestion API with Kafka producer
- [ ] Create the Kafka Consumer Processor to transform and store events into ClickHouse
- [ ] Build the Dashboard UI to visualize event data
- [ ] Dockerize the Ingestion API and set up Kubernetes for easier deployment
- [ ] Add Authentication & Authorization layers (API keys, JWTs) to the ingestion API
- [ ] Set up ClickHouse schema and ingestion pipeline for storing analytics
- [ ] Token refresh and expiry logic
- [ ] Hosted version of Streamory
